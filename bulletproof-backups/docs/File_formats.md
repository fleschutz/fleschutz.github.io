🛡️ File Formats for Backups
============================
**Question is: Will you be able to open today’s files in your data backups in 20 years?**

For example the original proposal for the World Wide Web (WWW), written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, is an important piece of internet history. However, this Word document can't be opened on modern computers.

**Solution is:** Use standard file systems/partitions/file formats/file suffixes and avoid non-standard/proprietary/exotic ones!
