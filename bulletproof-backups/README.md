🛡️ Bulletproof Backups
======================
**The *risk of data loss* threatens our valuable digital data - no smartphone, no PC, no data center is 100% safe! Prevent this from today on by data backups performed *on site* for quick recovery and kept *offline* to prevent ransomware attacks.**

📋 Planning & Preparation
--------------------------
- [x] **Read** the [FAQs](docs/FAQs.md) to plan your backup strategy, recommended is the [3-2-1 rule](docs/3-2-1_rule.md).
- [x] **Fetch** [hard drives](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=harddisk) with enough capacity from different vendors and models (maybe even rugged ones).
- [x] **Check** each hard drive for errors and use error-free ones only.
- [x] **Label** and rename each hard drive with an unique name, e.g. "Video backup #1 (4TB)".
- [x] **Download** the [repository (5.8MB)](https://github.com/fleschutz/bulletproof-backups/archive/refs/tags/1.1.zip), unzip it, and copy it as 📁*bulletproof-backups* folder onto each hard drive.
- [x] **Optional:** Check your [file formats](docs/File_formats.md).  
- [x] **Set up a reminder** in your digital calendar to perform the backup, e.g. every Friday.

▶️ Perform the Backup
---------------------
1. **Connect your mobile devices** to the PC and copy photos into the *Pictures* folder, videos into the *Videos* folder, and so on.
2. **Connect the next hard drive** to the PC and open: *bulletproof-backups* > *scripts*.
3. **Execute** each appropriate script by double-clicking, e.g. 📄*save_Home_folder.bat* copies your entire home folder to the drive at: *bulletproof-backups* > *DATA* > *Home_folder*
4. **Disconnect** the hard drive *properly* and store it *carefully* in a *separate* and *secure* location.

🪂 Recover Your Data
--------------------
1. **Choose** the hard drive with the *latest* backup. Read your Logbook.csv file if in doubt.
2. **Check** the hard drive. Read the [documents](docs/) if it's damaged.
3. **Connect** the hard drive to your PC and open: *bulletproof-backups* > *DATA*.
4. **Copy** or sync the missing or corrupted data back to your PC. DO NOT move the data! BE CAREFUL to set source and destination correct!
5. **Disconnect** the hard drive *properly* and store it *carefully* in a *separate* and *secure* location again.

💡 Hints
--------
* **At first** a full backup is performed (slow for big data), but next time only changes get copied (extremely fast).
* **No encryption** is performed to keep it simple and robust. Use an encryption program and a vault to prevent unauthorized access.
* **[Logbook.csv](docs/Logbook.csv)** gets updated automatically by the backup scripts (a table in .CSV format containing all the backup details).
* **Test** your backups regularly to ensure that they are working properly. Restore your backups to a test environment and check that all of your data can be accessed as expected.
* **DISCLAIMER:** All informations are given according to my best knowledge, but without guarantee.
